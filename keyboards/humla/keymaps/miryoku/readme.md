This layout is a shameless copy of [Miryoku QMK](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku) with some changes of my own to enable my mussle memory to just do it's thing.  
## Changes ##  
Arrow keys are in an inverted-T layout and the space bar is on the middle right thumb key. Cut/Copy/Paste keys have been set to the Win variant as that's the operating system I use the most.
## Building ##
This keymap can be compiled into firmware for your keyboard using the [QMK noobs guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) and the files in this repository.
